Programming Priority
  1. Creating golf ball and hole
  2. Setting up walls for golf course
  3. Programming golf movement and power when hit
    a. golf ball speed decreasing at constant rate (unless in a trap)
    b. determining angle at which golf ball bounces off of walls
  4. Programming level to end when you either run out of balls or you get the ball into the hole
    a. programming ball count
  5. Programming different playable levels that get harder as you go on
    a. deciding where the ball and where the hole should be placed
    b. deciding where the traps should be placed (magnets, sinkholes, sandtraps)
  6. Add images for all objects

Everything is programmable and will be able to be finished in the 12 allotted days.

12 Day Plan:

Day 1 = creating golf ball and hole
Day 2 = setting up walls for golf course
Days 3-6 = programming golf movement and power when hit
Day 7 = Programming level to end when you either run out of balls or you get the ball into the hole
Days 8-11 and half of day 12 = Programming different playable levels that get harder as you go on
Half of day 12 = add images for all objects

3 extra days:

Days 1-2 = add holes in the walls that the ball usually bounces off of
  - the ball will go through the hole and have to be hit back into the course from the deep green
Day 3 = add the option to chose the color of your ball and the flag at the finish hole
